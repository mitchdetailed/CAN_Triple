# CAN Triple 1.0 Documentation

The CAN Triple is designed to simplify the scope of interfacing multiple CAN Buses with a small form factor for Automotive Environments. Offers an Efficient and lightweight way to manage traffic among 3 CAN 2.0 Networks. Nearly all code should be written in the `*user_code.c*` file. Programming is completed by using a STlink V3 Debugger.

typedef struct {
    uint8_t Bus;             /**< ID of the CAN bus the message is associated with. */
    bool is_extended_id;     /**< True if using an extended ID, false if using a standard ID. */
    uint32_t arbitration_id; /**< The identifier for the message, either standard or extended based on is_extended_id. */
    uint8_t dlc;             /**< Data length code, the number of valid bytes in the data field. */
    uint8_t data[8];         /**< Data payload of the CAN message. */
} CAN_Message;

// we'll define the CAN_Message and call each field using the [dot] operator.
// eg, for which bus the message came from, use Message.Bus 
```
---

### Processing Received CAN Data.. 

There's a few functions to help process incoming CAN Message data to convert it to it's apppropriate data type. There's a few things to consider though.

If: The signal has ANY Decimal places, it will need to be stored as a float or double.

If: The signal is NOT a float or double, {AND} CAN hold a negative value at ANY time, it will need to be stored as a signed integer.

All other data can be stored as an unsigned integer.

### Storing signals as a float
```C
float process_float_value(uint32_t value, uint32_t bitmask, bool is_signed, float factor, float offset, uint8_t decimal_places);

//Input a value, bitmask, the is_signed Boolean, a factor, and offset and return a floating point. 
```
Lets assume the Engine speed is an unsigned 16 bit or 2 byte Big Endian CAN Signal on Bus 1 and Message ID 0x123 and is the first 2 bytes(indexes 0 and 1) of the Data field. It has a factor of 0.125 and an offset of 0 and we want to constrain to 3 decimal places. The code could be setup the following way. 

```C
float engine_Speed = 0;
onReceive(CAN_Message Message){
	if (Message.Bus == CAN_1){
        if (Message.arbitration_id == 0x123){
            // generic variable to hold the data bytes needed for the process
            uint32_t message_info = (Message.data[0]<< 8)| (Message.data[1]);
            engine_speed = process_float_value(message_info, 0xFFFF,false,0.125,0,3);
        }
    }
}
```

### Storing signals an integer
```C
int32_t process_int_value(uint32_t value, uint32_t bitmask, bool is_signed, int32_t factor, int32_t offset);
```
Lets assume the Engine Coolant Temp is an unsigned 10 bit Little Endian CAN Signal on Bus 1 and Message ID 0x124 and is the all 8 bits of the 3rd byte(index 2), and 2 bits of the 4th byte(index 3) of the Data field. It has a factor of 1 and an offset of -40. The code could be setup the following way. 

```C
int32 engine_coolant_temp = 0;
onReceive(CAN_Message Message){
	if (Message.Bus == CAN_1){
        if (Message.arbitration_id == 0x124){
            // generic variable to hold the data bytes needed for the process
            uint32_t message_info = (Message.data[3]<< 8)| (Message.data[2]);
            engine_coolant_temp = process_int_value(message_info, 0x03FF,false,1,-40);
        }
    }
}
```

### Storing signals an unsigned integer
```C
uint32_t process_unsigned_int_value(uint32_t value, uint32_t bitmask, uint32_t factor, uint32_t offset);
```
Lets assume the Engine Oil Pressure is an unsigned 10 bit Big Endian CAN Signal on Bus 1 and Message ID 0x125 and is the all 8 bits of the 6th byte(index 5), and 2 bits of the 5th byte(index 4) of the Data field. It has a factor of 1 and an offset of 0. The code could be setup the following way. 

```C
int32 engine_oil_pressure = 0;
onReceive(CAN_Message Message){
	if (Message.Bus == CAN_1){
        if (Message.arbitration_id == 0x125){
            // generic variable to hold the data bytes needed for the process
            uint32_t message_info = (Message.data[4]<< 8)| (Message.data[5]);
            engine_oil_pressure = process_int_value(message_info, 0x03FF,1,-40);
        }
    }
}
```

### Simple Bitmasking and bit shifting right (if needed)
```C
uint32_t process_raw_value(uint32_t value, uint32_t bitmask);
```
Lets assume you are wanting to extract a bit field for an AC switch found on CAN Bus 2 and Message ID 0x126. first byte, 5th bit [00010000]. The code could be setup the following way.
```C
uint32_t ac_Switch = 0;
onReceive(CAN_Message Message){
	if (Message.Bus == CAN_2){
        if (Message.arbitration_id == 0x126){
            ac_switch = process_raw_value(Message.data[0], 0x10);
        }
    }
}
```
---
### Rounding floats
```C
float roundfloat(float num, uint8_t decimal_places);
//provide the number, and how many decimal places you want to round to.
```
---
### Converting Floats to Decimal values with *10 factor for decimal places.
```C
int32_t roundfloat_to_int32(float num, uint8_t decimal_places);
```
Value will be an integer value decimal shifted by the decimal places.
```C
float startingvalue =  3.14159267;
int32_t endingvalue = roundfloat_to_int32(startingvalue, 4);
// endingvalue would == 31416
```
---
### Debugging with print statements
Debugging using print statements is offered in a few ways. while printf is supported, it is deprecated and recommend using a char array, snprintf, and serialPrint() for your code.

```C
float engine_Speed = 1234.567;
float vehicle_speed = 55.2;
int32_t engine_coolant_temp = 98;
char test = "Test_Message";
char debug_buffer[100];
snprintf(debug_buffer, sizeof(debug_buffer), "Engine Speed: %5.1f, Vehicle Speed:%2.1f,Coolant Temp = %i,  %s", engine_Speed, vehicle_speed,engine_coolant_temp,  test);
serialPrint(debug_buffer);
// "Engine Speed: 1234.6, Vehicle Speed:55.2,Coolant Temp = 98,  Test_Message" would be printed to terminal..
